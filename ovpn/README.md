# VPN Config Directory

This folder is used to store `.ovpn` configuration files for connecting to VPN services such as TryHackMe or Hack The Box.

Each user should place their own `.ovpn` files in this directory. These files are intentionally excluded from version control using `.gitignore` to protect sensitive credentials.

Do not commit or upload personal VPN configuration files to this repository.

If you are contributing to this project or testing, use placeholder or dummy `.ovpn` files that contain no sensitive data.
